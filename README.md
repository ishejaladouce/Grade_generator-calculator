## Project Overview
This Python application assists students in understanding how their assignment grades contribute to their overall course grade. It calculates the influence of individual assignments on the overall grade in the 'Formative/Summative' categories, computes GPA, and determines pass/fail status.

## Programming Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects)
- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries)
- Input/Output Operations
- Error Handling (try-except)
- Loops (while, for)
- Conditional Statements
- Type Validation
- String Formatting

## Features
1. **Input Collection**
   - Assignment name
   - Category (Formative/Summative)
   - Assignment weight (percentage)
   - Grade obtained (0-100%)

2. **Grade Calculations**
   - Individual assignment weighted grades
   - Category totals (Formative and Summative)
   - Overall GPA (out of 5)
   - Pass/Fail determination

3. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - Grade range validation (0-100%)
   - Weight validation per category
   - Data type validation
   - User input validation

## How to Use
1. Run the program
2. Enter assignment details as prompted
3. Continue adding assignments until done
4. Review the final grade report

## Pass/Fail Criteria
- **Pass:** Score at or above average total grade for both Formative and Summative categories
- **Fail:** Score below average in either or both categories
